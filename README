College data project from IS218 (November 2013)

When I was examining the data from the CSV files, I noticed that there were some missing records.
For example, the college with the highest enrollment (University of Phoenix Online Campus I believe)
didn't have any financial records.  This made the "Top Colleges" portion of the assignment impossible
because I didn't have all the information needed for some of the colleges.  Therefore, for
EVERY question in this assignment, only schools with COMPLETE records are shown (in other words,
they must have an id present in the college database, enrollment database, and financial database).
